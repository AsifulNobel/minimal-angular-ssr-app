# Minimal Angular v8 Application with Server Side Rendering

## What The App Does
A sample Angular application with a lazy loaded module that contains a single component. The job of the component is to show a random one or two digit number every x seconds. 

## Why The App Exists
This app is to represent a sample application that has lazy loading implemented as well as server side rendering(SSR). It can be used as an example of a hello-world like application that has lazy loading and SSR enabled. Moreover, it can be used to measure a hello-world like Angular application's performance with tools such as lighthouse. A lighthouse report of this app can be found [here](github/).
